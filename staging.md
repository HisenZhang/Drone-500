By adjusting approximated dots, we made the number of dots in three matrices about the same - 910, which means every drone would participate in the show (0 inefficiency). In final matrices, dots are modified manually to ma 





From previous stage we gained two lists which contain pairs of coordination of dots. The pairs of elements combine together to form a complete coordination. 

```
// List is a data structure in Python. 
// A linear list can be regarded as a set of elements.
// Sample output lists of x & y
x = [69, 70, 71]
y = [55, 55, 55]

That means we have dots (69,55) (70,55) (71,55).
```

By deducing half the length (width) from all elements in two lists we have the origin at the center of a picture now. For example:

```
This is a 8x8 matrix. Three dots presented.
x = [2,6,8]
y = [0,3,4]

Now move origin to the center.
For each element minus 4.

x = [-2, 2,4]
y = [-4,-1,0]

Now plot the figure. The orogin is at the center of graph.
```





By adjusting approximated dots, we made the number of dots in three matrices about the same - 910, which means every drone would participate in the show (0 inefficiency). In final matrices, dots are modified manually to approach exact 910 drones.
